-Ashita v4 Addon; Created and optimized for Retail. Private Server support extremely limited

--- BETA ----

This addon will help display all equippable items for the current job across all inventories (including those stored in slips).
Just as well, it gives a more comprehensive list of what stat bonuses are given from your equipped items.
There is a limited filter selection for being able to choose which items popup when selecting a slot.

1. Load the addon
2. On first run, and ***any*** time your inventory is updated and you have new items and/or new augments, you will need to hit "Rebuild Cache"

From there, click any slot to begin setting items into a working set. At any time, you are able to click "Equip Working Set" to attempt to equip the working set to your character.
Please note - Ashitacast takes priority, and will up-equip any items you have set. Recommended to disable using /lac disable before attempting to equip something. Once done, can of course reenable using /lac enable

*Not all stats are added to the addon yet. The list is growing as I continue to work on this. Please open an issue if you find any bugs*
